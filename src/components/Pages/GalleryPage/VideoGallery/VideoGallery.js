        7 April 2017 â€“ Depression is the leading cause of ill health and
        disability worldwide. More than 300 million people are now living with
        depression, an increase of more than 18% between 2005 and 2015. WHO is
        leading a global campaign on depression for World Health Day 2017, with
        the goal of enabling more people with mental disorders to live healthy,
        productive lives.
